## Predictive Analytics on Spread of Influenza
**Bryce Whitney, Neha Barde, Shen Juin Lee, Shrey Gupta**

### Project Description
The ability to model and predict the spread of disease is a crucial problem after COVID-19 demonstrated the massive global ramifications of failing to control a contagious virus at the beginning. While COVID-19 is an extreme example, there are strong benefits of being able to model more common diseases such as Influenza. For hospitals this manifests in understanding how much staff and space they need to handle flu patients in a certain week, or when pharmaceutical companies should invest more in distributing vaccinations. For the population as a whole, it allows people to make more informed decisions to help teveryone avoid getting sick. 

Research has proven that mobility is one of the strongest indicators of how a disease will spread through a population at all geographic scales, whether it be locally, state-wide, or nationally. Nearly all research investigating the use of mobility data in predicting the spread of contagious diseases has highlighted the strong predictive power of mobility data. All this research shares one major flaw, which is that mobility data is the lone dataset being used in the model. We believe mobility alone doesn't fully cover the important factors dictating how disease spreads through a population. We believe data such as the weather and population of a particular region also play important roles in disease spread.  Through combing weather and population data with mobility data, we seek to explore the value these datasets can add through analysis of New York county Influenza data from 2019 to 2022. A strong ability to predict the amount of Influenza cases will allow us to....
